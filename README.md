# 🌟 Personal Projects - I

Project-based learning is a fantastic way to grow as an engineer 🚀, and I have taken inspiration from various online resources and community-driven platforms 🌐.

Each project is designed to solve real-world problems 🌍 or demonstrate core concepts for my personal learning and growth 📚.

Feel free to explore and learn as well! 💡
